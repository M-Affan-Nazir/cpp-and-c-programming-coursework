/*

- when you increment a pointer; it goes up 'size of pointer'. I.e. '8 bytes'/
- ADT make you code a BlackBox. It is 'encapsulated'. The user of program does not know the implementation.
  All he knows how to use
  This makes the ADT highly secure. The user can never modify the data (in memory) directly 
  He needs your program interface to do so
-in C++ it is useful to add your ADT's definition in your header files
