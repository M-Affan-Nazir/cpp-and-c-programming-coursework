- COBALT for buissness men
  Fortran for Engineers and Scientist
  Both Object orietnted (represented real world objects using Classes);
  Objects and classes a breakthrough in 1960's
  Objects allowed complex relationships in your program by interaction of Object's

  but they were very very slow
  Founder of c++ thought, there should be a Object Oriented language for all people (buiessness men, scientist, banks); AND was FAST
  To be fast is to be close to hardware. C was the fastest and closest language to hardware; 
  Founder of C++ chose C (built be Dennis at Bell Labs); and decided to add classes
  C++ invented : The Holy Grail of Power and Speed

  C++ used in MainFrame Servers, Submarine Engine control units
  C/C++ mother of all languages; 
  C++ will never change (is the most stable LTS language) (all other languages change (python) )


- C++ is DIFFERENT than C
  concepts of memory, syntax is same; but everything else if different
